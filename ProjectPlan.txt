MAIN GOAL:  
To have an app that displays images, and some metadata - in "cards" or divs - so that someone
can look at an inventory (or catalog) of images, and 'like' or select the images they want

Also - I want to be able to have 3-5 'customers' who can look at their images with a drop
down select box - so the customer 'row' will have a one to many relationship
the drop down will have the following selections available:
1- "all images" 2- "treecare" 3-wentworth 4-marketing images
If at the beginning we want to have only 'all images' that works for now.

I also want to be able to toggle on and off the settings of the page with checkboxes
x - images only small
x - images only larger
x - images and title
x - images and file dimensions
etc.

TASK:  what do we want to start with?
I want to have images (that can be liked)
I want metadata like "file name", and "quickname" (its like a headding)
I want 'tiles' or 'divs' that hold metadata and images in the same container on the DOM

I want a database to hold relavent data
I want the ability to show or hide metadata like  image dimensions etc.
I need a folder to hold the images (and their link data)


will need a database
I will need react set up - so I have an app.jsx file - we did this when we spun up the project
I will need pg pool - on the command line
I will need axios - is a dependcy - we do this at the command line
I will need express - on the command line 
I do not plan to use anything like material UI. (because I hate dependncies... I hate them very much)
-some of this will be in node (on my machine)
